there are many timeout decorators out there - that one focuses on correctness when using with Classes, methods,
class methods, static methods and so on, preserving also the traceback information for Pycharm debugging.

There is also a powerful eval function, it allows to read the desired timeout value even from Class attributes.

It is very flexible and can be used with python >= 3.5, pypy3 and probably other dialects.

There are two timeout strategies implemented, the ubiquitous method using "Signals" and the second using Multiprocessing.
Using "Signals" is slick and lean, but there are nasty caveats, please check section `Caveats using Signals`_

The default strategy is therefore using Multiprocessing, but You can also use Signals, You have been warned !

Due to the lack of signals on Windows, or for threaded functions (in a subthread) where signals cant be used, Your only choice is Multiprocessing,
this is set automatically.

Under Windows the decorated function and results needs to be pickable.
For that purpose we use "multiprocess" and "dill" instead of "multiprocessing" and "pickle", in order to be able to use this decorator on more sophisticated objects.
Communication to the subprocess is done via "multiprocess.pipe" instead of "queue", which is faster and might also work on Amazon AWS.

supports python 3.6-3.8, pypy3 and possibly other dialects.

Try it Online
-------------

You might try it right away in Jupyter Notebook by using the "launch binder" badge, or click `here <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator/master?filepath=jupyter_test_wrapt_timeout_decorator.ipynb>`_

Installation and Upgrade
------------------------

Before You start, its highly recommended to update pip and setup tools:


.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip --upgrade setuptools
    python3 -m pip --upgrade wheel


install latest version with pip (recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

    # upgrade all dependencies regardless of version number (PREFERRED)
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git --upgrade-strategy eager

    # test without installing (can be skipped)
    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git --install-option test

    # normal install
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git


install latest pypi Release (if there is any):

.. code-block:: bash

    # latest Release from pypi
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade wrapt_timeout_decorator

    # test without installing (can be skipped)
    python3 -m pip install wrapt_timeout_decorator --install-option test

    # normal install
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade wrapt_timeout_decorator



include it into Your requirements.txt:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Insert following line in Your requirements.txt:
    # for the latest Release on pypi (if any):
    wrapt_timeout_decorator
    # for the latest Development Version :
    wrapt_timeout_decorator @ git+https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git

    # to install and upgrade all modules mentioned in requirements.txt:
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r /<path>/requirements.txt


Install from source code:

.. code-block:: bash

    # cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git
    $ cd wrapt_timeout_decorator

    # test without installing (can be skipped)
    python3 setup.py test

    # normal install
    python3 setup.py install


via makefile:

if You are on linux, makefiles are a very convenient way to install. Here we can do much more, like installing virtual environment, clean caches and so on.
This is still in development and not recommended / working at the moment:

.. code-block:: shell

    # from Your shell's homedirectory:
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitranox/wrapt_timeout_decorator.git
    $ cd wrapt_timeout_decorator

    # to run the tests:
    $ make test

    # to install the package
    $ make install

    # to clean the package
    $ make clean

    # uninstall the package
    $ make uninstall

1.0.5
-----
2018-09-13: use multiprocessing.pipe instead of queue
If we are not able to use signals, we need to spawn a new process.
This was done in the past by pickling the target function and put it on a queue -
now this is done with a half-duplex pipe.

- it is faster
- it probably can work on Amazon AWS, since there You must not use queues

1.0.4
-----

2017-12-02: automatic detection if we are in the main thread. Signals can only be used in the main thread. If the decorator is running in a subthread, we automatically disable signals.
