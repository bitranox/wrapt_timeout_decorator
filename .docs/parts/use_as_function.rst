use as function not as decorator
--------------------------------

You can use the timout also as function, without using as decorator:

.. code-block:: py

    import time
    from wrapt_timeout_decorator import *

    def mytest(message):
        print(message)
        for i in range(1,10):
            time.sleep(1)
            print('{} seconds have passed'.format(i))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        timeout(dec_timeout=5)(mytest)('starting')
