General Recommendations
-----------------------

It's recommended to minimize the utilization of timeouts in your programming, reserving them for truly essential instances.

Timers should be applied at an appropriate level of detail, tailored specifically to the needs of your application.
This precision aids in circumventing unwanted outcomes, such as the mishandling of exceptions by unrelated code sections
or complications with entities that cannot be pickled.

Conversely, it's prudent to refrain from embedding a Timeout Decorator within loops that execute multiple times.
Such an approach can induce notable delays, especially on Windows systems, owing to the additional burden of initiating subprocesses.

Where possible, opt for the timeout features natively available in the functions and libraries at your disposal.
These inherent capabilities are often adequate for the majority of use cases.
The implementation of a Timeout Decorator is best reserved as a measure of last resort,
subsequent to the exhaustive consideration of alternative strategies.

Additionally, be cognizant of the fact that the behavior and efficiency of subprocesses may vary significantly across platforms
(Windows versus Linux) and depending on the chosen method for subprocess initiation.
Refer to the documentation on `Subprocess Start Methods`_ for further details.


    BAD EXAMPLE (Pseudocode) - lets assume the write to the database fails sometimes for unknown reasons, and "hangs"

    .. code-block:: python

        # module file_analyzer
        import time
        from wrapt_timeout_decorator import *

        def read_the_file(filename):
            ...

        def analyze_the_file(filename):
            ...

        def write_to_database(file_content):
            ...


        @timeout(5)  # try to minimize the scope of the timeout
        def import_file(filename):
            file_content = read_the_file(filename)
            structured_data = analyze_the_file(file_content)
            write_to_database(structured_data)


    BETTER EXAMPLE (Pseudocode)

    .. code-block:: python

        # module file_analyzer
        import time
        from wrapt_timeout_decorator import *

        def read_the_file(filename):
            ...

        def analyze_the_file(filename):
            ...

        @timeout(5)     # better, because smaller scope
        def write_to_database(file_content):
            ...

        def import_file(filename):
            file_content = read_the_file(filename)
            structured_data = analyze_the_file(file_content)
            write_to_database(structured_data)
